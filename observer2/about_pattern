Q: When to Use the Observer Pattern?
A: In general, observer pattern can be used when we need many other objects
  to receive an update when another object changes.

Examples:
 1) Stock market with thousands of stocks needs to send updates to objects representing
   individual stocks.
 2) The Subject(publisher) sends many stocks to the Observers.
 3) The Observers(subscribers) takes the ones they want and use them.

Benefits:
 1) Loose coupling is a benefit - which means that the Subject(publisher) doesn't need to know anything
    about the Observers(subscribers).

Negatives:
 1) The Subject (publisher) may send updates that don't matter to the Observer(subscriber).


 Definition:
 The Observer pattern is a software design pattern in which an object called the subject, maintains a list of its dependents,
 called observers, and notifies them automatically of any state changes, usually by calling one of their methods..
